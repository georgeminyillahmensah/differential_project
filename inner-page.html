            <p>An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other organisms, as well as weather and landscape,
               work together to form a bubble of life. Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as well as abiotic
                factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature, and humidity.
              Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly.
              Ecosystems can be very large or very small. Tide pools, the ponds left by the ocean as the tide goes out, are complete, tiny ecosystems. 
              The whole surface of Earth is a series of connected ecosystems. Ecosystems are often connected in a larger biome. Biomes are large sections of land, sea, or atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>In predation, one organism kills and consumes another. Predation 
              provides energy to prolong the life and promote the reproduction 
              of the organism that does the killing, the predator, to the detriment
               of the organism being consumed, the prey. Predation influences 
               organisms at two ecological levels. At the level of the individual, 
               the prey organism has an abrupt decline in fitness, as measured by 
               its lifetime reproductive success, because it will never
              reproduce again. At the level of the community, predation 
              reduces the number of individuals in the prey population.</p>

                <u>Some advantages of predators in an ecosystem</u> 
              </strong>
              <p>Predators are an important part of a healthy ecosystem. Predators 
                remove vulnerable prey, such as the old, injured, sick, or very
                 young, leaving more food for the survival and success of healthy 
                 prey animals. Also, by controlling the size of prey populations,
                  predators help slow down the spread of disease.</p>

        <p>Infection of prey and predator species is a serious problem that must be addressed, as it plays a vital part in population control. 
          There are many examples of parasites infecting both the prey and the predator in the wild. As a result, fact dictates that we should be 
          vigilant with prey-predator environments in which all species are afflicted with disease.</p>

              <p>This model consists of two populations: the prey population and the predator population.
                Both the populations have two sub classes: susceptible and infected. At time T, let S(T) denotes the density
                of the susceptible prey, and I(T) denotes the density of the infected prey. The susceptible and infected

          <h2>Discussion of results</h2>
          <p>By doing a parameter sensitivity on some of the graph</p>
        </div>
        <a href="img/modi1.png"><img src="./img/modi1.png" alt=""></a>
        <a href="img/modi.jpeg"><img src="./img/modi.jpeg" alt=""></a>
        <p>We chose one of the conditions needed to meet a situation in the system, where both infected prey and infected predator die out entirely after some time.
          In this equilibrium, the author mentions that the conversion rate of healthy prey by healthy predators,c, must be greater than the death rate.
          
          We varied the parameter c and observed what happens to the different population groups.
          We realized that when c was less than 0.3, which was less than sigma 0.4
          The population was filled with only healthy prey.
          As the parameter c increased, the healthy predator populations increased, as the healthy prey population decreased.
          The effects balance each other out.
          One interesting thing to note is that the infected prey and infected predator population remains at 0.</p>
          <p>This situational equilibrium can be used to cull the infected population of any system naturally.
            For example, in a deer 🦌 and lion 🦁 population, 
            it can ensure that only the healthy groups of both animals survive. 
            A disease known as babesiosis, transmitted by a tick, attacks both deers and lions. 
            This model can be used to eliminate those groups of lions and deers who are infected by babesiosis.</p>

          <h2>Implications</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="description">From the graphs seen above, the prey population increases food for predators. However, the increase in the infected population
          moderates the population of the susceptible prey and predator.This relationship continues in different waves until an equillibrium point is reached. 
          
         The function <strong>E(s*,i*,x*,y*)</strong> represents that point at which all the populations are constant.
          At the equilibrium point, the rate at which susceptible prey become infected and also infected preys die will be constant. The same will happen
          for the predator population. And the natural death rate will also be constant.Therefore the ecosystem will be stable will the rate of death for both populations
          and, the growth rate and also the rate of infection will be constant throughout. </p> -->

          <h2>Further research</h2>
          <p>The subject area of a prey-predator model is vast. A lot of people have come out with different models around. But day in and day out, more parameters are discovered. A prey-predator is one of the significant parameters in the ecosystem needed to bring about balance and reduce food storage, dependency, and survival of the fittest.
          </p>
          <p><strong>With this, we plan to do more research on this subject area by using the following assumptions:</strong> </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> The disease spreads from infected prey to susceptible predators when it devours an infected one. The prey and predator, once infected, never recovers. It will either die or will be removed by predation for the prey.</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> Only the <strong>susceptible prey</strong> can reproduce. They further assume that the predator population has a natural death, whereas the infected population has a disease-induced excess death rate.</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> In the absence of predator population and with no disease, the prey population grows logistically
              with intrinsic growth rate r and environmental carrying capacity</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> The disease spreads among the susceptible prey when it comes in contact with the infected one. The prey once became infected, never recovers. It will either die or will be removed by predation</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> In the presence of the disease in prey, the infected prey population contributes to the susceptible prey population growth towards the carrying capacity</li>
            
          </ul>
          <p>With the assumptions above, we intend to do further research on the topic by considering if a disease infected both populations and the prey can become infected other prey when they come into contact with each other. The same also happens for the predators. Also, when a healthy predator eats an infected prey, it gets affected too.
          The health predators can catch both healthy and infected prey, but infected predators can catch only infected prey. When a prey or predators is infected, it cannot reproduce and recovered, and they can only die a natural death, and for the prey can also be removed by being devoured by a predator.</p>
